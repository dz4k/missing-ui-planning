## Browser version targets

`> 0.9%, last 2 versions, not dead` - Current browserslist expression seems to be malformed: 

`> 0.9% and last 2 versions, not dead` - seems more in line with intent, but reduces audience coverage to  \~60%

## Polyfills for popover and commandfor

For popover, we might be able to get away without a polyfill ([Oddbird Polyfill](https://popover.oddbird.net/))

We'll definitely need one for commandfor (roll our own)

deniz:

geoff:

> So `<button commandfor=mymenu command=toggle-popover>` would be needed to display a menu, which I'm also adding support for menus in `<aria-tab>` via the upcoming `aria-actions` attribute. Then `<aria-menuitem commandfor=...>` would be needed for menubar, unless you wanted to do `<aria-menubar><button role=menuitem commandfor=...>`, which I don't really like, since `role=button` and `role=menuitem` both inherit from the abstract `role=command` (along with `role=link`).

We will probably also need anchor positioning for menus ([Oddbird Polyfill](https://anchor-positioning.oddbird.net/))

## 19.js API redesigns

Unify mixins, tags and behaviors:

- Have a function to define a mix-havior (term tbd)
- The `tag` function takes a mixhavior and defines a custom element
- The `behavior` function (probably rename) applies the mixhavior to CSS selectors
  - Will warn on things that can't be applied, e.g. observed attributes
- Can mixins inherit from mixins? Should we allow `MultiSelectMixin` to extend `TypeAheadMixin` (which would extend `FocusGroupMixin`)? Also allows mixins to inherit from a validating mixin ([GH comment](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/missing/pull/142#discussion_r2478773001)).
- Can we mixinify everything? `tag` takes `observedAttributes`, `css` and `internals`, feels like those could be mixins
  - Probably a bad idea with how mixins work in JS (no deduplication -> deadly diamond problem)
  - [GH Comment](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/missing/pull/142#discussion_r2478855176) about `observedAttributes`, etc
- Should we implement some type of helper for e.g. `(el.internals || el).role` ?
- Consider this possible bug between FF and Chrome when running the validate mixin: <https://github.com/bigskysoftware/missing/pull/142#discussion_r2478828020>

## aria-icon

Looks for icons in a sprite sheet by default (`<use>` declaration), if not found, fetch from Lucide's public CDN

- log a warning the first time this happens
- Make a way to dump all icons used & a spritesheet generator based on that

Current impl. places a `<style>` tag in light DOM for each icon. We might be able to keep these styles in shadow DOM and apply them to the light DOM with `::slotted()`

- The svg element needs to be in the light DOM because `<use>` doesn't work across shadow boundaries

## Branding

Missing.css: Class-light CSS library, visual components and layout tools, Carson's original vision

Missing.js: Framework- and CSS-agnostic interactive widgets, work well with Missing.css but also without

Missing UI: Missing.css + Missing.js (+ Missing.rust, Missing.fortran, Missing AI, Missing Cafe)
