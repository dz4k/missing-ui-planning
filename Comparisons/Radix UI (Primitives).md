the home page is really confusing, it just cuts off. there are a bunch of unlabeled, indistinct horizontal lines that are a theme switcher. There are both headed and headless versions ("Themes" and "Primitives"). The same "Documentation" link in the navbar goes to different places based on where you are.

The headed and headless versions have different component sets.

I don't want to devote any more brain power to this.
