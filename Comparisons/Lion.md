## Framework-free
No. It depends on Lit.
> "Lion web components are built using LitElement as their base class." (https://lit.dev/docs/libraries/standalone-templates/)

## Framework-independent
Partial.
- **Yes** for consumption: You can use the components as standard HTML elements without writing Lit code.
- **No** for extension: Extending the components typically requires using Lit.

## Headless
Yes.
> "Lion is probably different than most current component sets in the sense that it deliberately does not put any styling on its components." (https://infoq.com/articles/lion-web-components/)

## Has styles
No.
> "The components come with only 'minimal styling' or 'functional stylings', intentionally leaving the aesthetic design to the implementer." (https://github.com/ing-bank/lion)

## Styleable
Yes.

## Classless
No.

## Buildless
Yes.
> "Thomas Allmer is a 'huge fan of buildless development' and advocates for working 'as close as possible to the Platform'." (https://infoq.com/articles/lion-web-components/)
